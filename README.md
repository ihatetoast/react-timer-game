# React timer game

A basic game to test your inner timer. Depending on the time given, the player starts a timer and then tries to stop it before the countdown finishes. All those friend/family of yours who think they have a good concept of time will be put to the test.

## How to play
- Chose a time (1s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 1min)
- Click start to initiate the timer
- Click stop as close to the set time as possible without going over

## Tools

- HTML5
- CSS
- JS (React)

## Purpose
- Following along with a tutorial (Maximillian Schwarzm√ºller) to get useRef() practice in. 
- Little surprise: Learning about the `useImperativeHandle` hook.  By creating a custom interface between parent and child, the parent can interact with the child because it is exposed to certain properties or methods whereas useRef allows for access.

## Expansion Ideas / To-Do
- Allow the user to determine a set time (< 5 minutes)
- Bring name from Player component into Results Modal
- Convert styling to Tailwind
